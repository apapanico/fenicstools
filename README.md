Description
-----------

The fenicstools repository contains tools for the FEniCS problem solving environment. 

_Notice_: This fork updates fenicstools to work with FEniCS version 2017.1.0, adhere to PEP8 formatting, and work with Python 3.  `Probe` and `Probes` have been verified to work but there are minor discrepancies in the examples in mikaem/fenicstools/wiki that can be easily fixed to work again.  Other features of the library have not been tested yet.

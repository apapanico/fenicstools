    This class implements efficient construction of Clement interpolant of an
    UFL-built expression. Here, the Clement interpolant is a CG_1 function
    over mesh constructed in two steps (See Braess' Finite element book):
        1) For each mesh vertex xj let wj the union of cells that share the
           vertex (i.e wj is the support of vj - the basis function of CG_1
           function space such that vj(xj) = 1). Then Qj(expr) is an L2
           projection of expr into constant field on wj.
        2) Set Ih(expr) = sum_j Qj(expr)vj.
